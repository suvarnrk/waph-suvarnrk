# Lab 0 - Development Environment Setup 

## Overview 

In the Web Application Programming and Hacking course, I used the UC Sandbox to put up a the latest version of Ubuntu virtual machine for Lab 0. I set up the necessary programs, including the Google chrome , the text editor Sublime Text, GitHub, the Apache server2, and Pandoc. I made a private Git repository on GitHub, shared it with the instructor, and cloned it locally to make cooperation easier. I made sure it was clear by actively amending README.md, which enhanced the project documentation. Lastly, I finished the Lab 0 activities and used Pandoc to create a well-formatted PDF report that demonstrated my command of web development technologies and my ability to communicate effectively.

## Part I - Ubuntu Virtual Machine & Software Installation

I followed the instructor's guidance to access the CECH sandbox at the University of Cincinnati for using the Web Application Programming and Hacking virtual machine. After the VM deployment, I opened it through the remote console, establishing a connection to the Ubuntu VM.

### Apache Web Server Testing

### The course repository

Include a **screenshot** to show that you have cloned the course repository into the home directory in your VM.

### Private Repository

Created a new private repository with name suvarnrk-waph as suggested by the instructor and added professor as a collaborator using his username phung-waph and requested him.

 I created an SSH key on my local computer and copied the id_rsa.pub public key to GitHub via Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key in order to enable SSH authentication. Using the SSH link, cloned the repository now.GitHub.

 I inserted a headshot image and modified the README.md file using the instructor's template after cloning the repository to my local computer. The picture was posted straight to github.com's "images" subdirectory. I then committed and staged these changes before submitting them to the remote repository. I made more edits to the README.md file on GitHub after the push. I used the terminal to get the most recent updates from the remote repository and apply them locally. My local copy precisely reflected the most recent GitHub updates thanks to this procedure.

Include a **screenshot** to illustrate that you committed the changes from your VM to your remote repository.

## Submission

Use the `pandoc` tool to generate the PDF report for submission from the `README.md` file, and ensure the report and contents are rendered properly.

The PDF file should be named `your-username-waph-lab0.pdf`, e.g., `phungph-waph-lab0.pdf`
